        <h2>Project Summary</h2>

        <p>Welcome to my project summary page, where I showcase my skills, experiences, and fun facts. This site serves as a dynamic representation of my diverse background in economics, law, operations, and marketing. My objective is to leverage my experiences and interests to navigate the dynamic professional world. Through this platform, I aim to contribute my analytical, strategic, and communication skills to forward-thinking organizations while continuously expanding my knowledge and making a meaningful impact.</p>

        <p>The design of this page follows a modern text style with a sleek gray and black color scheme, providing a clean and professional look. The use of visuals, transitions, and hover effects enhances the user experience and adds a touch of sophistication to the presentation. I've employed a responsive and intuitive navigation system, allowing users to seamlessly explore different sections of the site.</p>

        <p>As for extras, I've integrated subtle animations, such as zoom-in effects on experience cards and hover effects on skills in the skills section. These extras not only add visual appeal but also provide a more engaging and interactive user experience. If you're curious about the plugins or technologies used, feel free to explore the code for more details.</p>
